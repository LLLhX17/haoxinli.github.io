							<p>As a Structural Engineer Intern at Guangzhou EHang Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd, I played an instrumental role in augmenting the capabilities of Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs). 
								My most significant contribution was designing an innovative automatic load and unload add-on component using CATIA and SOLIDWORKS. 
								This component streamlined the operational efficiency of the AAVs. Additionally, I actively engaged in cross-departmental collaborations, 
								where I participated in intensive discussions to validate the testing performances of the developed component. Through these collaborative efforts, 
								we ensured the design was optimized for efficacy and reliability.</p>

							<p>As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Toronto, I contributed to both undergraduate and graduate-level courses in engineering and data analytics. 
								In MIE540 Product Design, I prepared and assisted in labs for a class of 87 students under the professorâ€™s guidance. I designed the grading scale, 
								and was responsible for grading assignments, lab reports, and midterms, in addition to providing feedback on student design projects.</p>
							<p>In MIE1628 Cloud-based Data Analytics, I played a pivotal role in shaping a graduate course on Big Data and Cloud Analytics, 
								which involved the curation of content covering critical platforms and technologies. My responsibilities included leading specialized tutorials, 
								creating assignments, and managing grading to cover course content and student comprehension. Moreover, 
								I took an active role in addressing student queries, ensuring they had a thorough understanding of the course material. 
								Through these experiences, I demonstrated a commitment to academic excellence and fostering student success.</p>

							<p>As a Coach at Guangdong Genesis Youth Radio Club, I dedicated five summers to fostering young talents in Amateur Radio Direction Finding (ARDF). 
								My role encompassed organizing daily training sessions for students, which included imparting fundamental knowledge about radio technology and instructing them on radio repair. 
								Furthermore, I took on a mentorship role, advising a team comprising over 40 students as they competed in provincial competitions. 
								My expertise in the field was further recognized as I was entrusted with the responsibility of serving as a referee in both provincial and national ARDF competitions. 
								Through my coaching and guidance, I was instrumental in nurturing the next generation of radio enthusiasts and competitors.</p>
